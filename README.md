# JHinimal

A [Minimal UI](https://minimals.cc) Starter Kit for [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech) Based Application.

## Features

This starter kit has the following features:

- Authentication using JWT
- User management

## Getting started

### Configure `.env` file

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and paste it as `.env` then configure it according to your needs.

> This starter kit uses [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) to upload images. Go create an account and generate an API key and put it as the value of `REACT_APP_IMGBB_API_KEY`.

### Install dependencies

In the project root directory, run:

```shell
yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
